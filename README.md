sidebar: false
---

Welcome to the Feathers documentation! Feathers is a web-framework for creating real-time applications and REST APIs using JavaScript or TypeScript with Node.JS, React Native and the browser. It works with any backend supporting many databases out of the box and with any frontend technology like React, VueJS, Angular, Android or iOS.

At its core, Feathers is a set of tools and an architecture pattern that make it easy to create scalable REST APIs and real-time applications. With Feathers, you can literally build prototypes in minutes and production-ready apps in days.
