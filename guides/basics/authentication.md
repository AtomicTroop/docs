# Authentication

By now we created a couple of [services](./services.md) and [hooks](./hooks.md) that make for a fully functional chat application. In order to use it however, we first need to create a new user and get a little bit of an idea how Feathers authentication works. We'll also discuss how to add a "Login with GitHub" functionality (this step is optional).

> __Note:__ When using Feathers in the browser most of the manual steps shown in this chapter will be taken care of automatically.

## User registration and authentication

## GitHub login
